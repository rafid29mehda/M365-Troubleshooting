Microsoft Purview Message Encryption (formerly known as Office 365 Message Encryption or OME) is a service that helps organizations protect and control sensitive email messages. Here's what you need to know:

### Overview
Microsoft Purview Message Encryption allows users to send and receive encrypted emails, ensuring that only authorized recipients can read the message content. It integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365 and is part of the broader suite of Microsoft Purview compliance solutions.

### Key Features
1. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Works with Outlook and other email clients.
   - No need for recipients to have special software; they can read encrypted emails through a secure web portal.

2. **Protection Policies**:
   - Administrators can define rules and policies to automatically encrypt emails based on content, recipient, or other criteria.
   - Customizable templates to enforce different levels of encryption and rights management.

3. **User-Friendly Experience**:
   - Users can easily send encrypted emails by selecting a “Do Not Forward” or “Encrypt” option in Outlook.
   - Recipients receive an email with instructions on how to view the encrypted message securely.

4. **Rights Management**:
   - Supports Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) sensitivity labels.
   - Controls on actions such as forwarding, copying, and printing of encrypted messages.

5. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Helps organizations comply with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and more.
   - Encryption keys are managed by Microsoft, ensuring robust security and compliance.

### How It Works
1. **Sending an Encrypted Email**:
   - A user composes an email in Outlook and selects an encryption option (e.g., Encrypt-Only or Do Not Forward).
   - The email is encrypted before it leaves the sender’s outbox.

2. **Receiving an Encrypted Email**:
   - The recipient receives a notification email with instructions to view the encrypted message.
   - If the recipient is using Outlook or another compatible client, they may be able to view the encrypted message directly.
   - Alternatively, they can access a secure web portal to read the encrypted email.

3. **Reading an Encrypted Email**:
   - The recipient authenticates themselves (e.g., via a Microsoft account, a one-time passcode, etc.).
   - Once authenticated, the recipient can view the encrypted message and any attachments securely.

### Example Scenario
Imagine a healthcare provider needing to send patient information via email. To comply with HIPAA regulations, they use Microsoft Purview Message Encryption to ensure that the email content is protected and accessible only by the intended recipient.

1. The healthcare provider composes an email in Outlook containing sensitive patient data.
2. They select the “Encrypt” option before sending the email.
3. The recipient (a patient or another healthcare provider) receives a notification and follows the instructions to view the encrypted email securely.
4. The recipient authenticates and accesses the encrypted message, ensuring that the sensitive information remains confidential.
