Anti-spam measures in Microsoft 365 are designed to protect users from unwanted and potentially harmful emails, such as spam and phishing attempts. These measures are part of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and include a variety of policies and tools to filter and manage email traffic. Here's a detailed overview:

### Key Components of Anti-Spam Measures in Microsoft 365

Anti-spam protection in Microsoft 365 is a key feature that helps safeguard your email communication against spam and phishing attacks. Here's a summary of how it works and how you can manage it:

1. **Automatic Protection**: Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes are automatically protected against spam by EOP¹.

2. **Spam Filtering Technologies**: EOP uses proprietary spam filtering technologies that learn from known spam and phishing threats, as well as ongoing feedback from admins and users¹.

3. **Spam Filtering Verdicts**: EOP classifies messages using spam filtering verdicts like Spam, High confidence spam, Phishing, High confidence phishing, and Bulk¹.

4. **Anti-Spam Policies**: You can configure the default anti-spam policy and create custom anti-spam policies that apply to specific users, groups, or domains. These policies determine the actions to take based on the spam filtering verdicts¹².

5. **Preset Security Policies**: The Standard and Strict preset security policies have actions that are already configured and unmodifiable, providing a baseline of protection¹.

6. **Reporting**: If you disagree with a spam filtering verdict, you can report the message to Microsoft as a false positive or a false negative¹.

7. **Anti-Spam Message Headers**: The anti-spam message headers can tell you why a message was marked as spam or why it skipped spam filtering¹.

For more detailed information on how to configure and manage anti-spam policies in Microsoft 365, you can refer to the official Microsoft documentation on [Anti-spam protection](^1^) and [Configure anti-spam policies](^2^). These resources provide comprehensive guidance and best practices for setting up and maintaining effective anti-spam measures within your organization.

1. **Spam Filtering Policies**:
   - **Inbound Spam Policies**: These policies are used to manage how incoming emails are filtered. You can configure settings to handle spam, bulk emails, phishing attempts, and other unwanted messages.
   - **Outbound Spam Policies**: These policies help prevent your domain from being used to send spam. They control the number of emails a user can send and monitor outbound traffic for suspicious behavior.

2. **Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)**:
   - ATP includes features such as Safe Links and Safe Attachments that help protect against malicious links and attachments in emails.

3. **Zero-hour Auto Purge (ZAP)**:
   - ZAP continuously monitors and removes spam and phishing emails that have already been delivered to users' mailboxes.

4. **Anti-Phishing Policies**:
   - These policies help detect and block phishing attempts by analyzing the email content, sender information, and other characteristics to identify potentially harmful emails.

### Configuring Inbound Spam Policies

To configure inbound spam policies, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Security & Compliance Center**:
   - Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center and navigate to the Security & Compliance Center.
   
2. **Create or Modify a Spam Filter Policy**:
   - Under **Threat Management**, select **Policy** > **Anti-spam**.
   - You can create a new policy or edit an existing one.

3. **Set Spam Filtering Options**:
   - **Bulk Email Threshold**: Set the threshold for bulk emails. A higher value means more bulk emails will be allowed through.
   - **Phishing Threshold**: Configure how aggressively the system should filter phishing attempts.
   - **Actions for Spam**: Choose whether to move spam to the Junk Email folder, quarantine it, or delete it.

4. **Advanced Spam Filter (ASF) Settings**:
   - Enable or disable ASF settings like "SPF record: hard fail" to handle specific scenarios.

### Configuring Outbound Spam Policies

1. **Create or Edit Outbound Policies**:
   - In the Security & Compliance Center, go to **Threat Management** > **Policy** > **Anti-spam** > **Outbound spam filter policy**.

2. **Set Sending Limits**:
   - Configure limits for the number of recipients per hour and per day to prevent spamming.
   - Example: Set a daily limit of 10,000 recipients with a sub-limit of 2,000 external recipients.

3. **Automatic Forwarding Control**:
   - Disable or restrict automatic forwarding of emails to external addresses to prevent misuse.

4. **Monitor and Respond**:
   - Regularly review reports and alerts about outbound email activity to detect and address any suspicious behavior promptly.

### Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update your spam policies to adapt to new threats.
- **User Training**: Educate users about recognizing and handling spam and phishing emails.
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhance security by requiring MFA for accessing email accounts.

Certainly! Let's walk through an example scenario where you want to configure an anti-spam policy in Microsoft 365 to protect a specific department in your organization, such as the Sales department, from spam emails.

**Scenario**: The Sales department has been receiving an increased number of spam emails, and you need to create a custom anti-spam policy to tighten the filtering for this group.

**Steps to Configure Anti-Spam Policy**:

1. **Log in to the Microsoft Defender Portal**:
   - Navigate to the Microsoft Defender portal at `security.microsoft.com`.
   - Go directly to the Anti-spam policies page¹.

2. **Create a New Anti-Spam Policy**:
   - In the Microsoft Defender portal, select **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Anti-spam** in the **Policies** section.
   - Click on **+ Create** to start configuring a new anti-spam policy.

3. **Configure Policy Settings**:
   - Name your policy (e.g., "Sales Department Anti-Spam Policy").
   - Under **Applied To**, select **The recipient is a member of...**, and choose the Sales department group.
   - Adjust the spam filter settings to a higher level of protection. For example, set the **Bulk email filter** to a higher threshold.

4. **Define Actions for Detected Spam**:
   - Choose what action to take when an email is marked as spam. For instance, you might choose to move these messages to the users' Junk Email folders.

5. **Review and Save the Policy**:
   - Review all the settings to ensure they meet the department's needs.
   - Save the policy. It will now be applied to the members of the Sales department.

6. **Monitor and Adjust the Policy**:
   - After applying the policy, monitor its effectiveness through reports and user feedback.
   - Make adjustments as necessary to ensure optimal protection without over-filtering legitimate emails.

Remember, it's important to regularly review and update your anti-spam policies to adapt to evolving threats and changes in your organization's email flow. For a more detailed guide, including screenshots and additional options, you can refer to the official Microsoft documentation on configuring anti-spam policies¹. Additionally, you may find video tutorials helpful for visual guidance on the process⁵.
