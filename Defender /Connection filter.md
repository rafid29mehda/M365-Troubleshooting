### Connection Filter in Microsoft 365

The connection filter in Microsoft 365 is a feature used to manage and control incoming email traffic based on the sender's IP address. It helps to block or allow email from specific IP addresses, enhancing the security of your email environment by preventing spam, phishing, and other unwanted emails from reaching your users.

#### Key Components of Connection Filtering

1. **IP Allow List**:
   - This list includes IP addresses that are always allowed to send email to your organization, bypassing spam filtering.
   - Useful for ensuring that trusted partners' emails are not mistakenly marked as spam.

2. **IP Block List**:
   - This list contains IP addresses that are always blocked from sending email to your organization.
   - Useful for blocking known spam or malicious sources.

3. **Safe List**:
   - A dynamic list of trusted IP addresses maintained by Microsoft to help reduce false positives.

### Configuring Connection Filters

To configure connection filters in Microsoft 365, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Security & Compliance Center**:
   - Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
   - Navigate to the Security & Compliance Center.

2. **Create or Edit a Connection Filter Policy**:
   - In the Security & Compliance Center, go to **Threat Management** > **Policy** > **Connection Filter**.

3. **Add IP Addresses to Allow or Block Lists**:
   - **IP Allow List**: Add IP addresses that you trust and want to allow through the spam filter.
     - Example: Add the IP address of a trusted business partner.
   - **IP Block List**: Add IP addresses that you want to block.
     - Example: Block IP addresses from regions known for high spam activities.

4. **Save and Apply the Changes**:
   - After configuring the lists, save the policy and ensure it is applied to your organization.

### Scenario-Based Troubleshooting

#### Scenario 1: Legitimate Emails Blocked by Connection Filter

**Issue:**
Legitimate emails from a trusted partner are being blocked and not reaching your users.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sender's IP Address**:
   - Obtain the sender's IP address from the email headers or by contacting the sender.

2. **Check the Connection Filter Policy**:
   - Go to **Threat Management** > **Policy** > **Connection Filter**.

3. **Add the IP Address to the IP Allow List**:
   - In the connection filter policy, add the sender's IP address to the IP Allow List to ensure their emails bypass spam filtering.

4. **Save and Monitor**:
   - Save the changes and monitor the email flow to ensure the issue is resolved.

#### Scenario 2: Spam Emails Not Being Blocked

**Issue:**
Spam emails from a known source are not being blocked and are reaching your users.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Source IP Address**:
   - Obtain the IP address from the email headers of the spam emails.

2. **Update the Connection Filter Policy**:
   - Go to **Threat Management** > **Policy** > **Connection Filter**.

3. **Add the IP Address to the IP Block List**:
   - Add the identified IP address to the IP Block List to block emails from that source.

4. **Save and Monitor**:
   - Save the changes and monitor the email flow to ensure the spam emails are blocked.

#### Scenario 3: False Positives from Safe List

**Issue:**
Emails from IP addresses on the Safe List are being marked as spam.

**Solution:**

1. **Review Safe List**:
   - Check the dynamic Safe List managed by Microsoft to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.

2. **Add IP Addresses to IP Allow List**:
   - If the Safe List is causing issues, manually add the problematic IP addresses to your IP Allow List to override the Safe List settings.

3. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Continuously monitor email traffic and adjust the IP Allow and Block Lists as necessary.

### Best Practices

- Regularly review and update your IP Allow and Block Lists.
- Monitor email flow and user feedback to quickly identify and address any issues.
- Educate users on reporting spam and phishing emails to help improve your filtering accuracy.
