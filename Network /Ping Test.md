The result of the ping command to `outlook.office365.com` provides information about the network latency (round-trip time) between your computer and the Microsoft 365 server located at IP address `52.98.86.162`. Here's what each part of the result means:

1. **Pinging Address**:
   - `MAA-efz.ms-acdc.office.com [52.98.86.162]`: This line indicates the domain name (or hostname) being pinged and its corresponding IP address.

2. **Ping Responses**:
   - `Reply from 52.98.86.162: bytes=32 time=81ms TTL=235`: Each line represents a response from the server.
     - `Reply from`: Indicates that the server responded to the ping request.
     - `bytes=32`: Specifies the size of the data packet sent in the ping request.
     - `time=81ms`: Shows the round-trip time (in milliseconds) for the ping request.
     - `TTL=235`: Indicates the Time-To-Live value of the packet, which decrements with each hop in the network.

3. **Ping Statistics**:
   - `Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)`: Provides statistics about the packets sent and received during the ping test, indicating that all packets were successfully received.
   - `Minimum = 71ms, Maximum = 128ms, Average = 89ms`: Displays the minimum, maximum, and average round-trip times for the ping requests sent.

### Interpretation:
- The ping test sent four packets to the Microsoft 365 server and received all four responses without any loss.
- The round-trip times varied between 71ms and 128ms, with an average round-trip time of 89ms.
- Lower round-trip times indicate faster network responsiveness, while higher times may suggest network congestion or latency.

In summary, the result indicates that there is network connectivity between your computer and the Microsoft 365 server, with acceptable round-trip times for the ping requests.
